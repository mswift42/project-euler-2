# Counting summations
# Problem 76

# It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

# 4 + 1
# 3 + 2
# 3 + 1 + 1
# 2 + 2 + 1
# 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
# 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

# How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?
# Really not much difference to Euler 31.

def changes(amount, coins):
    ways = [0] * (amount + 1)
    ways[0] = 1
    for coin in coins:
        for j in range(coin, amount + 1):
            ways[j] += ways[j - coin]
    return ways[amount]
 

print (changes(100, range(1,100)))
